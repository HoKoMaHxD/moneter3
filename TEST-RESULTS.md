# Verification — SNOW Clan Monitor 2.1.0

- Node.js tests: **61 passed**, **1 optional MongoDB integration test skipped** because no temporary local MongoDB server/URI was available.
- Python tests: **16 passed**, including targeted reads, permission/auth distinctions, minimal event forwarding, rate-limit duration, mocked worker lifecycle and dependency diagnosis.
- JavaScript syntax checks passed. Python worker files compiled successfully.
- `npm run check:reader` passed offline with Python 3.12.14 and discord.py-self 2.1.0. No real credentials or Discord login were used.

The Node tests exercise the Python stdio adapter with an offline child fixture, including the existing scanner's outsider/absence/sanction classification. They also exercise the real command handler with mocked external clients to verify removal of the former activity command and voice tracking, preservation of help/status, and handling a duplicate command message only once.

Existing tests continue to verify initial sanction baselines, transitions, log deduplication, encrypted token replacement, partial results, incomplete clan snapshots, and live changes winning over older scan results.

The real MongoDB test remains opt-in through `MONGO_TEST_URI` pointing to a temporary server on `127.0.0.1`. It must not use production data. Live Discord access, actual Arena permissions, event coverage, latency and account-lock behavior have not been verified in this environment. Changing libraries does not establish protection from account restrictions.

## 2026-11-11 — Token modal expiry fix

- Added stateless, HMAC-authenticated Discord modal IDs scoped to the requesting user, guild, reader slot and 10-minute validity.
- Added six offline cryptographic validation cases and three simulated real-handler cases.
- **9/9 added tests passed** using `node --test test/token-modal.test.js test/modal-flow.test.js`.
- All JavaScript files passed `node --check`.
- The original Node test suite could not be re-run in this environment because installing the full `discord.js` / `mongodb` dependency set timed out. Live Discord and MongoDB interactions were not verified.
